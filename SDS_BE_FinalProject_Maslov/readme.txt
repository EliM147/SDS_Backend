Greetings, traveler!

In this project you are to embark on a journey of seeing how the mysteries
of API and REST design of web application development are unveiled via this
Backend project for the Software Dev Skills.

In case you are in for the ride, to begin with, you could acknowledge yourself
with the link on YouTube as to how the project is supposed to work:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfMZnmIngPc

To set up the project to work, you must have MongoDB installed.
Next, you must create a new database called 'customerapp' (use customerapp),
and then inside it, make a collection of 'users' db.createCollection('users').

Consequently, you shall get a git bash opened inside the SDS_Final folder.
To run the app, write 'nodemon' in there.

Then, you could see for yourself into the ubiqutous world of backend development!

You could:
- Add or remove a customer from the main page.
- Automatically calculate the number of entries in the users collection (wow!)
- Operate the data with the help of MongoDB (amazing!)
- Use e.g. resteasy to perform CRUD operands on the MongoDB data (..fantastic!)
- Use the fast-travel links to go to API pages (incredible!!)

Hope you enjoyed the intro reading more than I did fixing bugs in the code!

Farewell!
